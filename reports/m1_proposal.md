## Motivation and Purpose
<!-- Describe the motivation behind the project and its intended purpose. -->
Our Role: Data analytics consultancy firm specializing in job market insights.

Target Audience: Job seekers and industry analysts.

Data-related job salaries vary widely based on experience, location, industry, and skill set. 
Understanding these salary trends is crucial for both job seekers and employers to make informed career and hiring decisions. 
If we could analyze the key factors influencing salaries in data-related roles, we could provide valuable insights to professionals navigating the job market.
To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization app that allows users to explore a dataset of salaries and job trends across different industries, locations, and roles.
Our app will display salary distributions, trends over time, and comparisons between job titles, enabling users to identify patterns and insights.
Additionally, interactive filtering will allow users to explore pattern changes by data role and year.
