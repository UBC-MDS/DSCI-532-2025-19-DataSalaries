# ðŸ’° DataSalaries - Explore Salary Trends in Data Science Roles  ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¼

Welcome to the DataSalaries, an interactive tool designed to analyze and visualize salary trends in the data science field.

## Summary

DataSalaries is an interactive dashboard designed to provide in-depth analysis and visualization of salary trends within the data science field. By examining trends over time and comparing salaries across various roles, experience levels, and work environments, the dashboard delivers actionable insights for job seekers, employers, and industry analysts. Our goal is to help users make informed decisions about compensation and career planning based on reliable, data-driven insights.

## Who are we?  

We are a data analytics consultancy firm specializing in job market insights, dedicated to providing clear, data-driven analysis to support career planning and market research. Our team combines expertise in data science and labor market trends to deliver actionable insights to job seekers and employers.

## Our Motivation and Purpose  

Data-related job salaries vary widely based on experience, location, industry, and skill set. Understanding these salary trends is crucial for both job seekers and employers to make informed career and hiring decisions. If we could analyze the key factors influencing salaries in data-related roles, we could provide valuable insights to professionals navigating the job market. To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization app that allows users to explore a dataset of salaries and job trends across different industries, locations, and roles. Our app will display salary distributions, trends over time, and comparisons between job titles, enabling users to identify patterns and insights. Additionally, interactive filtering will allow users to explore pattern changes by data role and year. 

## The Dashboard

The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for exploring salary trends across multiple dimensions. Users can interact with visualizations to compare salaries by role, experience level, company location, and work arrangement.
